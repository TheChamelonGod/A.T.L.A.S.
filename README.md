This is my first time writing in c++, ill add more here once im on the polishing stage, u can look at my comments tho.
btw, it stands for Adaptive Time-Lapse Automated System, hate on it if u want, i thought it was cool.

Build it urself in this buggy unfinished easily re-creatable version with simple python knowledge. 
g++ main.cpp -o ATLAS.exe -std=c++17 -mconsole -I C:\msys64\ucrt64\include\opencv4 -L C:\msys64\ucrt64\lib -lopencv_core -lopencv_imgcodecs -lopencv_imgproc -lgdi32
gotta have msys64 and downloaded opencv, change dir to where urs are.
